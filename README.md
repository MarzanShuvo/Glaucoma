# Glaucoma Using ORB AND BRIEF FEATURE

>I have implemented a Machine learning model for detecting glaucoma.
Here, Brief feature detector was firstly implemented from a paper. After implementing the paper, I then used ORB feature for detecting the glaucoma. The result was quite nice from the Brief based model. This was a fun project as beginner of machine learning algorithm.
